- On me `/usr/bin/rbenv/bin/rbenv` seems fishy ðŸ˜…
- Go to server and check your `rbenv` path by `which rbenv` on me is `/usr/bin/rbenv`
- Add to your `deploy.rb` e.g like this

```sh
set :rbenv_custom_path, "/usr/bin/rbenv"
```

- Of course need to ssh-add [your key] again but [link](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58835804/6469234) somehow it is the private key(?)
- Remove pub
```
set :ssh_options, { ... , keys: %w(~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) } # from with .pub
set :ssh_options, { ... , keys: %w(~/.ssh/id_rsa) } # to without .pub
```
- Add ssh key again the private NOT the pub `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa` without .pub
