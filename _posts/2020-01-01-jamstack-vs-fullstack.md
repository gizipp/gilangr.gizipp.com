When I heard JAMstack, it certainly not like newest technology. JAMstack are actually using well-known technologies.

What makes diffirent?

In short, the way you can build websites with it follows a non-traditional approach, slightly different from what we have known for years.

When I heard about JAMStack, the ecosystem was still in its infancy. But now, there are dozens of SSGs, headless CMSs, and third-party services over there.

## Can it compete with Full-stack?

Certainly NOT!

And NEVER!

Because it doesn't even trying to compete. It's for different use case and solving problem with different approach. Solve your problem alongside it.

Why bother using big crane to build small tree house in your backyard?

To put in simply, choose the right tools for the job.
