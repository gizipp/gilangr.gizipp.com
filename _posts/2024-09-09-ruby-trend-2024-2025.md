Ruby 2024 and soon 2025 will be...

---

Ruby has been around for a while, but it continues to surprise developers with its adaptability and charm. As we step into 2024 and as we move into 2025 soon, Ruby isn't just surviving; it's thriving. Whether you’re a seasoned Rubyist or just curious about what’s new, here’s what you need to know about the latest innovations and trends in Ruby for the coming year.


## Ruby 3.3: Speed Meets Efficiency

Ruby’s performance has been a hot topic for years, and with Ruby 3.3 (released late in 2023), speed and efficiency are the name of the game. The language has made leaps in reducing execution times and memory usage, bringing it closer to its "3x faster" goal compared to Ruby 2. This year, developers will feel a noticeable difference, especially in web applications and real-time systems.

One big push has been around the YJIT (Yet Another JIT), which has seen serious improvements. JIT compilation is now faster and more stable, giving Rails developers a smoother experience when scaling applications. So if you haven't upgraded to Ruby 3.3 yet, it's time to make the move and enjoy the performance boost.

### 2025 Insight
Let's see Ruby 3.4 pushing performance even further. In 2025, Ruby 3.4 is making waves with its continued focus on performance and efficiency.

## Hotwire and Turbo in Rails: The Full-Stack Revolution

When it comes to modern web development, Ruby on Rails has always been a major player. But with the introduction of Hotwire and Turbo into Rails, 2024 is all about building responsive, real-time applications without relying heavily on JavaScript. This new approach is making Rails developers rethink how they build user experiences.

Hotwire, which bundles Turbo and Stimulus, allows for fast, interactive pages without the overhead of complex frontend frameworks like React or Vue. The trend this year? More apps powered by Hotwire and Turbo to deliver real-time updates without sacrificing simplicity. Expect to see an uptick in projects that blend the magic of server-rendered HTML with snappy interactions.

### 2025 Insight

As Rails continues to evolve, Hotwire and Turbo remain central to building rich, real-time applications. 2025 sees more developers fully embracing these technologies, as they allow for smooth, interactive experiences without over-relying on JavaScript frameworks.

By 2025, many new Rails projects will be built around this stack, thanks to its simplicity and power. With fewer dependencies on complex frontend frameworks like React or Vue, Rails developers can now ship real-time, full-stack applications more quickly than ever before. Hotwire's approach is turning Rails into a go-to framework for real-time web apps, and the momentum isn’t slowing down.

## AI and Machine Learning with Ruby: Gaining Ground

AI and machine learning have dominated the tech landscape recently, and Ruby is finally catching up. Although Python remains the go-to language for machine learning, the Ruby community is showing more interest in integrating AI features into Ruby applications.

In 2024, we’re likely to see better tools and libraries, like ruby-dnn and TensorFlow.rb, getting traction. These tools bring deep learning capabilities to Ruby. With Ruby’s intuitive syntax and community support, it’s becoming easier for developers to add machine learning features to their apps. Expect more articles, gems, and tutorials focused on Ruby's AI capabilities in the coming months.

### 2025 Insight

AI in Ruby: Moving from Novelty to Necessity

2025 marks the year when AI and machine learning in Ruby shift from niche experiments to essential components of Ruby applications. While Python remains dominant in the AI space, Ruby has been making steady progress.

New libraries like AI.rb and improved bindings for TensorFlow.rb are empowering Ruby developers to embed AI capabilities directly into their applications. In fact, 2025 might be the year where we see Ruby AI gems mature enough to rival their Python counterparts for common tasks like natural language processing or predictive analytics. For Ruby developers eager to get into AI, 2025 is looking like a good year to dive in.


## Security Takes Center Stage

With an increase in cyber threats, security has become a top priority for developers, and Ruby is no exception. The Ruby community is doubling down on security in 2024, with new gems and best practices to ensure that applications built on Ruby remain safe.

Bridgetown, a static site generator, is gaining popularity for security-conscious developers. It allows you to build fast, secure sites with less risk of attacks like SQL injection or XSS (cross-site scripting). Additionally, Rails 7 has introduced more built-in security features, making it easier for developers to implement secure authentication, encryption, and authorization in their applications. So, if security hasn’t been on your radar, now’s the time to prioritize it.

### 2025 Insight

Security has always been crucial, but with cyber threats increasing in sophistication, 2025 puts security front and center for Ruby developers. As more data-heavy and high-traffic applications are built on Ruby, the need for solid security practices has never been greater.

Tools like Brakeman (a Ruby static analysis tool for security vulnerabilities) have been updated to keep pace with modern threats, and Ruby’s ecosystem is focusing on automated security audits as part of the CI/CD pipeline. Rails 7 and beyond have also introduced more granular security controls, including stricter defaults for secure authentication and session management, making it easier for developers to protect their apps from malicious attacks.


## Conclusion: Ruby’s Evolution Continues,

In 2024, Ruby is evolving in exciting ways, blending speed, efficiency, modern web development techniques, and even AI. Whether you're building scalable web applications or tinkering with AI features, Ruby offers something for everyone. The introduction of tools like Hotwire and the continuous improvements in performance with Ruby 3.3 ensure that Ruby will remain relevant and loved by developers across the globe.

### 2025 Insight : Ruby is Ready for 2025 and Beyond

As 2025 unfolds, Ruby is evolving in all the right ways. From pushing performance boundaries with Ruby 3.4 to redefining real-time web development with Hotwire, and even stepping into AI territory, the language is far from stagnant. Ruby remains a beloved and increasingly powerful tool for developers across the globe.

With a solid focus on speed, real-time web capabilities, and security, Ruby is ready to tackle the challenges of 2025. Whether you’re building large-scale apps or experimenting with AI, Ruby’s innovations are ensuring it stays relevant and exciting for the years ahead.

As the community grows and innovation continues, Ruby’s future looks bright. So, buckle up, and let's see where this versatile language takes us in 2024 and soon 2025!
