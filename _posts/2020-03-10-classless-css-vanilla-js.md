Lately, front-end web development tools and technologies are going crazy. It's rapidly moving in fast pace.

And the ~~bad~~ good news is, it still going on!

***

## It's moving fast, to the point you can't 100% catch up anything.

Although I never dedicated myself as front-end developer.
I mostly have bad nightmare because of that.

Have you ever heard React? Or Vue! Bower, Gulp, Webpack...

Or maybe Babel,

Bulma,

How about layout?

It is Flexbox based?

PWA.. service-worker.. AMP

AMP ready and valid?

Let's looks check structured data...

Am I missing mentioning something? Certainly, YES!

### React, Vue, Bower, Gulp, Webpack

To be honest, you don't even want 100% mastering Bootstrap right?

Do feel the same way I do?

You miss your glorious time when front end is about HTML/JSS and adding simple Javascipt? And viola!

### Classless CSS

There is a lot of debate about classless or even no-class CSS.

But when Bulma come out, I think I am enough with CSS-Framework. It's more than enough, in the point that is too much.

It certainly made for faster development pace. But in most of case, they bloated your site. It's imported a lot of classes/scripts that you even never used it. It's not that I 100% hate with CSS Framework. It's certainly true, most of decent CSS Framework nowadays build in modular design, so you can import any thing. But sometime, simplicity is the best.

And here we go Classless CSS!

And also...

### Vanilla JS

It's plain JS.

### Summary

Practice YAGNI! You ain't gonna need it. It is certainly good to keep up with new technology. But, don't get overwhelmed. The first and foremost thing is, any tools and technologies are made to make your life easier. Practice how to use it efficiently and when to NOT use it wisely.

When it makes your life harder. Think about it!
