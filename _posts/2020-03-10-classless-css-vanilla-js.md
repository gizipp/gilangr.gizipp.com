Lately, front-end web development tools and technologies are going crazy. It's moving in fast pace.

And the ~~bad~~ good news is, it still going on.

***

## It's moving fast, to the point you can't 100% catch up anything.

Have you ever heard React? Or Vue, Bower, Gulp, Webpack...

Babel,

Bulma,

PWA.. service-worker..

AMP

How about layout? It is Flexbox based?

And PWA... serviceworker..

AMP ready and valid?

Am I missing mentioning something? Certainly, YES!

To be honest, you don't even want 100% mastering Bootstrap right?

### React, Vue, Bower, Gulp, Webpack

Do feel the same way I do?

You miss your glorious time when front end is about html+css and adding some javascipt? And viola!

### Classless CSS

There is a lot of debate ""

When Bulma come out,

I am enough with CSS-Framework. It's more than enough, in the point. It certainly made for faster development pace.

It's not that I 100% hate with CSS Framework.

 but it's bloated your site.

### Vanilla JS

ES6

### Summary

Practice YAGNI! You ain't gonna need it. It is certainly good to keep up with new technology. But, don't get overwhelmed. The first and foremost, any tools and technologies are made to make your life easier. Practice how to use it efficiently and when to NOT use it wisely.
