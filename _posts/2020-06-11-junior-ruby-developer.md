The story of how I became a Junior Ruby Developer, in one month.

***

I considered lucky to have habits logging my daily life and activities. It is easier to gauge how I achieve something.

Since I have logged my early days with Rails on "[20 Days of Rails](https://blog.gizipp.com/20-days-of-rails)" (sorry, It's written in Bahasa), I give a thought how I became a Ruby developer as now, in my first month. And why I choose this path.

Here's the folk!

***

This is not a story about became ninjas in Sofware Engineering and Web development. This is just an ordinary story, how we coincidentally tied with some we passionate about.

At the end of 2014 I gave serious thought to professionally work as a Web Developer, I was 25 back then. Too old to start, personally. But it's not too late, right?

For the last 3 years, I had been working on various freelance jobs, well paid but completely mindless job. And then I fell into web development because I have blogging as my hobbies.

Accidentally I saw vacancy "PHP" but with special append. It crossed in my mind a lot.

"PHP Developer (Trained to be Ruby Developer)"

Looking at SoftwareSeni vacancy "PHP" trained to Ruby, I check about Ruby. And I don't why I fell in love.

It is beautiful.

That's all.

My choice fell on programming → Web → Ruby on Rails. I am not going to explain why, I was googling this subject a lot and choosing what would be more interesting for me and more suitable for my career.

The salary is quite good, and the fun thing is available for you.

And then I prepare my CV, and then  I apply to Software Seni, take a test, and yes, I am failed.

Yes, I am failed.

But, how come I became Ruby Developer later?
