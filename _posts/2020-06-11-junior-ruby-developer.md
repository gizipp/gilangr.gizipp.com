The story of how I became a Junior Ruby Developer, in one month.

This is not a story about became ninjas in Sofware Engineering and Web development e.g .

This is just an ordinary story, as human, and how we coincidentally tied with some we passionate about : Ruby.

I considered lucky to have habits logging my daily life and activities. It is easier to gauge how I achieve something.

Since I have logged my early days with Rails on "[20 Days of Rails](https://blog.gizipp.com/20-days-of-rails)" (sorry, It's written in Bahasa), I give a thought how I became a Ruby developer as now, in my first month. And why I choose this path.

Here's the folk!

***

At the end of 2014 I gave serious thought to professionally work as a Web Developer, I was 25 back then. Too old to start over new thing, personally. But it's never too late to learn, right?

For the last 3 years before, I had been working on various freelance jobs, well paid but completely mindless job. And then I fell into web development because I have blogging as my hobbies, and simply love to tweak template of my blog. And after while, I am familiar with html, css, js and also a little php because of WordPress.

On the year of 2014, I accidentally saw vacancy "PHP" but with special append. It crossed in my mind a lot.

"PHP Developer (Trained to be Ruby Developer)"

Looking at [SoftwareSeni](https://www.softwareseni.com/) vacancy "PHP" trained to Ruby, I check about Ruby. And I don't why I fell in love.

It is beautiful.

That's all.

My choice fell on programming → Web → Ruby on Rails. I am not going to explain why, but I was googling this subject a lot and choosing what would be more interesting for me and more suitable for my career.

The salary is quite good, and the all fun thing is available for you : productive and happiness. :)

And then I prepare my CV, and then I apply to Software Seni, take a test, and yes, I am failed.

Yes, I am failed.

I was failed test to became WordPress Developer.

Yes!

I was applying for WordPress Developer position! Not PHP or even Ruby. Because I don't have confident and skillset on PHP or even Ruby.

But, how come I became Ruby Developer later?
